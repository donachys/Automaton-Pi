============

Raspberry Pi Automaton

The Automaton-Pi project intends to create a platform for further development of an autonomous RC car. 

Supervised data may be captured by human user input to a Playstation controller. The controller communicates with a Raspberry Pi mounted on the vehicle via bluetooth. The acceleration and steering of the vehicle is controlled with python commands.

see the wiki at https://github.com/donachys/Automaton-Pi/wiki for specific commands.
